######          Moxl_ Speedometer for Arduino Pro Micro  
######          You're free to do whatever with it.      

 ###### Why Pro Micro ? 
    * It's what I had, and it's compact.

 ###### What do I need?
    * Arduino Pro Micro (probably each Leonardo will do)
    * Hall sensor + magnet (most generic sensor with breakoutboards)
    * SSD1306 128*64 I2C screen.
    * SPI SD card reader + SD card (mine says HW-125)
        * SD card should be formatted in FAT32 (quickformat on windows in fat will do.)

 ###### Why sdFat & SSD1306Ascii libraries?
    * The Pro Micro was tad bit overloaded in SRAM.
    * They're both lightweight in comparrison.
